# Inspirational Quotes Chrome Extension 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and uses the [React Google Sheet Connector](https://github.com/danielstorey/react-google-sheet-connector)

The extension was an experiment to play with the Google Sheets API and react together, exploring using a spreadsheet as a data source.

The data source has 3 columns and over 700 rows with the following attributes

* Column A: id 
* Column B: quote
* Column C: author

and can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1liNJM9nH_bslOQ-criwS_yzyVoVtVZ28U4kuscOewnU/edit#gid=0)
